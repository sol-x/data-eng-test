# Data Engineer Test

## Instructions

- Build an ETL process that would transform the data from loaded from a local file i.e. `data/location.json` and from a remote data source i.e. `https://53c1a51d-616b-4aea-9e2a-89b2c8024b72-bluemix.cloudant.com/events` to the desired schemas and store them in a SQL database.

- Desired schema 1:

  | Column     | Description                                               |
  | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
  | id         | Primary key                                               |
  | user_id    | User id                                                   |
  | event_type | Event type                                                |
  | location   | Location i.e. where the user was when the event triggered |
  | timestamp  | Date time                                                 |

  **Note:** This is essentially the same data as what is found in the remote CouchDB database but enriched with location. The output should have the same number of rows as the remote CouchDB database. 


- Desired schema 2:

  | Column      | Description                                           |
  | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | date        | Date                                                  |
  | user_id     | User id                                               |
  | location    | Location e.g. `zone-1`                                |
  | time_spent  | Total time spent at location in minutes               |
  | visit_count | Count of how many times the user was at that location |

- You can use a SQLite database if you do not want to set up a proper SQL database for this test but do write the code such that it would be trivial if a switch to a proper SQL database is required.

- Please write this code as though it will be ***deployed to a production*** environment.

## Submitting your solution

Please archive the entire test directory and email your solution back to us. Please ***do not fork*** the project on git or submit a pull request with your solution as we would prefer it to remain private.

```shell
$ git archive -o <candidate-name>-submission.zip HEAD
```

We would like it if you would submit your solution as multiple git commits with descriptive commit messages.

## Data source

### JSON file

Location: `data/location.json`

| Key       | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| user_id   | User id                    |
| location  | User's location            |
| timestamp | Unix epoch in milliseconds |

- Each record indicates a change in the user location. E.g.

  ```json
  // User "01G29P9SP04M59QJ8YNKAT1Y0Z" was detected at location "zone-2" at
  // "1641024008859" i.e. 2022-01-01T08:00:08.859Z
  {
    "user_id": "01G29P9SP04M59QJ8YNKAT1Y0Z",
    "location": "zone-2",
    "timestamp": 1641024008859
  }

  // At "1641024029364" i.e. 2022-01-01T08:00:29.364Z, the same user has
  // moved to "zone-3"
  {
    "user_id": "01G29P9SP04M59QJ8YNKAT1Y0Z",
    "location": "zone-3",
    "timestamp": 1641024029364
  }
  ```

### CouchDB

Location: `https://53c1a51d-616b-4aea-9e2a-89b2c8024b72-bluemix.cloudant.com/events`

| Key        | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| \_id       | Document id                                    |
| \_rev      | Document revision                              |
| event_type | Event type e.g. ENTER_GEOFENCE, HIGH_HEAT      |
| user_id    | User id                                        |
| timestamp  | ISO 8601 date time e.g. `2022-05-05T08:44:28Z` |

- Document id and revision are CouchDB implementation details and are not pertinent for this test.

- Each record indicates a triggered event

  ```json
  // User "01G29PB08CC2G72K9JF7FJ6F2N" entered a geofenced zone at
  // 2022-01-01T08:02:10.263Z
  {
    "_id": "4c026ba25bd3c7ed5a4290271c02862d",
    "_rev": "1-1f9339a905e0d68f6040c22019fad7cc",
    "event_type": "ENTER_GEOFENCE",
    "user_id": "01G29PB08CC2G72K9JF7FJ6F2N",
    "timestamp": "2022-01-01T08:02:10.263Z"
  }
  ```

- To fetch all the records in the `events` database

  ```shell
  $ curl "https://53c1a51d-616b-4aea-9e2a-89b2c8024b72-bluemix.cloudant.com/events/_all_docs?include_docs=true"
  ```
